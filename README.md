ReeseTradeAlgo

ReeseTradeAlgo is a Python-based trading algorithm designed to analyze historical market data, calculate technical indicators, and predict price movements using machine learning techniques. This algorithm leverages data from the Alpha Vantage API for historical market data and TA-Lib for technical analysis.

## Features

- **Historical Data Retrieval:** Fetch historical market data from Alpha Vantage API.
- **Technical Indicator Calculation:** Calculate technical indicators such as MACD, RSI, stochastic oscillator, and Bollinger Bands.
- **Machine Learning Model Training:** Train a machine learning model (HistGradientBoostingClassifier) to predict price movements.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model accuracy using test data.
